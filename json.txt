This model was explicitly studied by Unruh in 2007 (CRYPTO 2007), but dates back to the seminal paper of Hellman in 1980 about time-space tradeoffs for inverting random functions, and has natural applications in settings where traditional random oracle proofs are not useful: (a) security against non-uniform attackers (b) space-time tradeoffs (c) security against preprocessing (d) resilience to backdoors in hash functions.\nWe obtain a number of new results about ROM-AI, but our main message is that ROM-AI is the "new cool kid in town": it nicely connects theory and practice, has a lot of exciting open questions, leads to beautiful math, short definitions, elegant proofs, surprising algorithms, and is still in its infancy. In short, you should work on it!\nBio:\nYevgeniy Dodis is a Professor of computer science at New York University. Dr. Dodis received his summa cum laude Bachelors degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University in 1996, and his PhD degree in Computer Science from MIT in 2000.\xa0 Dr. Dodis was a post-doc at IBM T.J.Watson Research center in 2000, and joined New York University as an Assistant Professor in 2001. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2007 and Full Professor in 2012.\nDr. Dodis\' research is primarily in cryptography and network security. In particular, he worked in a variety of areas including random number generation, leakage-resilient cryptography, cryptography under weak randomness, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash function and block cipher design, protocol composition and information-theoretic cryptography. Dr. Dodis has more than 100 scientific publications at various conferences, journals and other venues, was the Program co-Chair for the 2015 Theory of Cryptography Conference and the editor of Journal of Cryptology, has been on program committees of many international conferences (including FOCS, STOC, CRYPTO and Eurocrypt), and gave numerous invited lectures and courses at various venues.\nDr. Dodis is the recipient of National Science Foundation CAREER Award, Faculty Awards from IBM, Google and VMware, and Best Paper Award at 2005 Public Key Cryptography Conference. As an undergraduate student, he was also a winner of the US-Canada Putnam Mathematical Competition in 1995.\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/events/275667', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-06 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 2.402', u'name': u'Theory Seminar- Yevgeniy Dodis/New York University, Fixing Cracks in the Concrete: Random Oracles with Auxiliary Input, Revisited'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Social Event where ACM members will be able to get to know each other by playing both classic as well as new board games.\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/rooms/275325', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-09-22 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 6.302', u'name': u'ACM Board Game Night'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Stop by and chat with Bloomberg Software Engineers, play with the famous Bloomberg Terminal, and grab swag and a snack from our pantry!\nAlso, join us for a tech talk at 6pm in GDC 6.302.\xa0 Food will be provided!\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/events/273567', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-09 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 6.302', u'name': u'Bloomberg Company Day!'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u"Value Semantics:\xa0 It ain't about the syntax!\nIn this talk, we begin by gaining an intuitive feel for what we mean by *value* by identifying *salient* *attributes*, i.e., those that contribute to value, and by contrasting types whose objects naturally represent values with those that don't.\xa0 After quickly reviewing the syntactic properties common to typical value types, we dive into the much deeper issues that *value* *semantics* entail.\nFood will be provided!\nRegister here!\n", u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/events/273568', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-09 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 6.302', u'name': u"Bloomberg Tech Talk: Value Semantics: It Ain't About the Syntax!"}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'The MAD (Mobile App development) web development wokshops.\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/rooms/274958', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-09-11 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 4.302', u'name': u'MAD Web Workshops'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Stop by the atrium to grab donuts & coffee and meet with representatives from Bloomberg!\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/events/273043', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-10 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 4.302', u'name': u'Rise & Dine with Bloomberg'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Come join WiCS for a QA session with Airbnb over brunch.

Sequentially, it sorts n elements in O(nlog n) steps cache-obliviously with an optimal number of cache misses. In also runs in O(log n\xa0 loglog n) parallel steps, which is\xa0 close to the optimal bound for any parallel sorting algorithm.\nSPMS is multithreaded and it has other useful properties, such as low cache miss overhead and low false sharing cost in a parallel execution. SPMS is resource-oblivious in that the dependence on machine parameters appears only in the analysis of its performance, and not within the algorithm itself.\n(Joint work with Richard Cole.)\nBio:\nRamachandran\'s research interests are in theoretical computer science, in the area of algorithms and data structures, especially with reference to graph algorithms and parallel algorithms. A major focus of her current research is on algorithms for multicore computing.\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/events/275723', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-20 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 4.302', u'name': u'Theory Seminar- Vijaya Ramachandran/University of Texas, Resource-Oblivious Sorting on Multicores'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Indeed will be hosting a coding competition on 10/20 on UT campus from 5:30 - 8pm!

However, formal theoretical understanding of why SGD can train neural networks in practice is largely missing.\nIn this talk, I will talk about our recent work on understanding this mystery by providing a convergence analysis for SGD on a rich subset of two-layer feedforward networks with ReLU activations. This subset is characterized by a special structure called \u201cidentity mapping\u201d. We prove that, if input follows from Gaussian distribution, with standard O(1/\\sqrt{d}) initialization of the weights, SGD converges to the global minimum in polynomial number of steps. Unlike normal vanilla networks, the \u201cidentity mapping\u201d makes our network asymmetric and thus the global minimum is unique. To complement our theory, we are also able to show experimentally that multi-layer networks with this mapping have better performance compared with normal vanilla networks.\nBio:\nYang Yuan is a sixth year CS PhD student at Cornell University, advised by Professor Robert Kleinberg. He did his undergraduate study at Peking University (2008-2012). He was a visiting student at MIT/Microsoft New England (2014-2015), and Princeton University (2016 Fall).\xa0 He is interested in theory for machine learning and optimization, especially how stochastic gradient descent algorithm works for non-convex functions.\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/events/275477', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-27 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 4.302', u'name': u'Theory Seminar- Yang Yuan/Cornell, Convergence Analysis of Two-layer Neural Networks with ReLU Activation'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'All UTCS Grad students, faculty and staff are invited to a\xa0TGIF celebration!\xa0\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/events/273046', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-27 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 4.302', u'name': u'TGIF with Sandia'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Mobile App Development Hack Night\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/rooms/275351', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-30 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 6.302', u'name': u'MAD Hack Night'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'MAD (Mobile App Development) web workshop\n', u'hyperlink': u'https://apps.cs.utexas.edu/calendar/rooms/274963', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-30 00:00:00', u'location': u'Room: GDC 1.304', u'name': u'MAD Web Workshop'}, {u'org_name': u'Computer Science', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Dr. Jain will be talking to the Turing scholars about her research in computer architecture.

The title of the lecture is, "Mexican American History in Tough Times." Professor Pitti\u2019s lecture focuses on the importance and influence of Mexican American history as an academic field and a subject of public concern today. He explores the recent interest in Mexican American history, and the venues and places where Mexican American history has recently made an important difference. At a time in which U.S. history is being debated and often misrepresented by policymakers, he describes efforts by scholars and others to emphasize a more accurate portrayal of the Mexican American past in court cases, in discussions of historical monuments and public spaces, in textbooks, and more. He suggests that these efforts have taken on special urgency with the rapid population growth of ethnic Mexican and other Latino communities throughout the United States, and because so many students and educators have insisted upon making Mexican American history more visible in their school curricula. Stephen Pitti (Ph.D., Stanford University) is Founding Director of the Yale Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity, and Transnational Migration.

What role should historians have? Both the long history of climate research and the more recent rise of climate change denial have been well documented by historians of science. Environmental historians, too, have explored the far-reaching social effects of past climate events that may foreshadow humanity\u2019s future. This talk will examine how and why historians should use our research and teaching to historicize climate change, climate science, and climate denial. Megan Raby is Assistant Professor of History and a Faculty Associate at the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. She earned her Ph.D. in the History of Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2012. She has published articles in the journals Environmental History and Isis\u2013\u2013the latter was awarded the History of Science Society\u2019s 2016 Price/Webster Prize.

Abstract: Sariska Tiger Reserve, in Rajasthan, India primarily supports its large rural population by providing fodder for livestock. To acquire this natural resource, women are tasked with shepherding livestock into the reserve or going to collect it and bring it back to the livestock safely tied up at home. Women's disproportionate risk to encountering a tiger or leopard compared to their male family members falls well within established feminist political ecology findings of women's gender roles and risk. However, still, to be explored, are hidden social costs as a result of the gendered division of labor within a network of apex predators and economic dependence on the vegetation within tiger territories. Through 20 focus groups, this research explores those hidden costs. Specifically, I explore links between women\u2019s bodily risk in providing for livestock, which fluctuates in accordance with large carnivore encounters that result in variation in livestock milk production. At the small scale this variation may result in domestic violence, or at a larger scale result in social stigma and shame at the inability to pay for dowries. These social, at-home and in-community costs are not part of the discussion on tiger reintroduction initiatives, yet may have enormous impacts on attitudes of those living alongside tigers, and thus overall conservation success.", u'hyperlink': u'https://calendar.utexas.edu/event/gender_symposium_dowries_tigers_more_than_physical_risk_from_gendered_divisions_of_labor_in_human-tiger_landscapes', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-06 14:00:00', u'location': u'Garrison Hall (GAR), 1.102 128 INNER CAMPUS DR , Austin, Texas 78705', u'name': u'Gender Symposium: Dowries &Tigers: More than Physical Risk from Gendered Divisions of Labor in Human-Tiger Landscapes'}, {u'org_name': u'UT Campus', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Do you have data that you\u2019re not sure how to use?

Despite this vaunted place in the country\u2019s postwar art history, it is commonly characterized as promoting a rationalist, stringent practice of geometric abstraction and unfavorably contrasted to the more intuitive and expansive approach of Rio de Janeiro\u2013based abstract artists in what became Neo-Concretism\u2014the movement, launched in 1959, that has received more attention than any other of Brazil\u2019s contributions to contemporary art. In this talk, Assistant Professor of Art and Art History Adele Nelson asserts that the crux of Grupo Ruptura\u2019s approach entailed the conception of art as a form of knowledge and social relation more so than a claim to stylistic unity or hard-and-fast antagonism to figuration. The group\u2019s leader, artist and critic Waldemar Cordeiro, was, along with critic M\xe1rio Pedrosa, one of abstraction\u2019s most significant interpreters in Brazil in the decade following World War II. Nelson analyzes the parallels Cordeiro constructed between non-representational abstraction and day-to-day, material reality, and his criticisms of the private, exclusionary nature of the new modern art institutions in Brazil in relationship to his engagement with the discourses of Marxism and formalist art theory. Adele Nelson is assistant professor in the Department of Art and Art History at The University of Texas at Austin. She received her BA in Portuguese and Brazilian Studies and Art Semiotics from Brown University and her MA and PhD in Art History from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. She specializes in twentieth- and twenty-first century art of Latin America, with a focus on the postwar and contemporary art of Brazil.

Crew Distinguished Teaching Professor of History, University of Texas at Austin Dr. Crew's faculty profile page Bodies and Ruins explores changing German memories of World War II as it analyzes the construction of narratives in the postwar period including the depiction of the bombing of individual German cities. The book offers a corrective notion rising in the late 1990s notion that discussions of the Allied bombing were long overdue, because Germans who had endured the bombings had largely been condemned to silence after 1945. David Crew shows that far from being marginalized in postwar historical consciousness, the bombing war was in fact a central strand of German memory and identity. Local narratives of the bombing war, including photographic books, had already established themselves as important \u201cvectors of memory\u201d in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The bombing war had allowed Germans to see themselves as victims at a time when the Allied liberation of the concentration camps and the Nuremberg trials presented Germans to the world as perpetrators or at least as accomplices. The bombing war continued to serve this function even as Germans became more and more willing directly to confront the genocide of European Jews\u2014which by the 1960s was beginning to be referred to as the Holocaust. Bodies and Ruins examines a range of local publications that carried photographic images of German cities destroyed in the air war, images that soon entered the visual memory of World War II. Despite its obvious importance, historians have paid very little attention to the visual representation of the bombing war. This book follows the search for what were considered to be the \u201cright\u201d stories and the \u201cright\u201d pictures of the bombing war in local publications and picture books from 1945 to the present, and is intended for historians as well as general readers interested in World War II, the Allied bombing of German cities, the Holocaust, the history of memory and photographic/visual history. \u201cSmart, thought-provoking, engaging, and important. The topic of the bombing war has moved to center stage in discussions of how best to remember and commemorate the end of the Second World War in Germany, but we know very little about the ways in which \u201cbodies and ruins\u201d\u2014the causalities of the bombing war\u2014were remembered in the fifty years or so after 1945. David Crew fills in that story.\u201d \u2014Robert Moeller, University of California-Irvine Dr. Crew\u2019s work has been featured on Not Even Past, including several interviews and original essays: Normal Pictures in Abnormal Times; Photographing the German Air War, 1939-1945; Virtual Auschwitz; Gunter Demnig\u2019s \u201cStumbling Blocks\u201d; and a review of Saul Friedl\xe4nder\u2019s book The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945.

Weaving together keenly observed interactions with root-seekers alongside historical details and revealing personal narrative, she shows that genetic genealogy is a new tool for addressing old and enduring issues. Nelson explains how these cutting-edge DNA-based techniques are being used in myriad ways, including grappling with the unfinished business of slavery: to foster reconciliation, to establish ties with African ancestral homelands, to rethink and sometimes alter citizenship, and to make legal claims for slavery reparations specifically based on ancestry. Alondra Nelson is professor of sociology and the inaugural Dean of Social Science at Columbia University. On September 1, 2017, she will become President of the Social Science Research Council, an independent nonprofit that for more than nine decades has been dedicated to advancing research for the public good. She is the author of The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation after the Genome and Body and Soul: The Black Panther Party and the Fight against Medical Discrimination, which was recognized with multiple scholarly awards and has been translated into French. Chair-elect of the Science, Knowledge and Technology Section of the American Sociological Association, her books also include Genetics and the Unsettled Past: The Collision of DNA, Race, and Historyand Technicolor: Race, Technology, and Everyday Life. In 2002, she edited \u201cAfrofuturism,\u201d an influential special issue of Social Text. Dr. Nelson has contributed to national policy discussions on inequality and about the social implications of new technologies, including artificial intelligence, big data, and human gene-editing. Alondra serves on the board of directors of the Data & Society Research Institute. She sits on the editorial boards of Social Studies of Science,Social Text, and Public Culture. Her essays, reviews, and commentary have appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, Science, and on National Public Radio, among other venues.

About Jenkins of Mexico: In the city of Puebla there lived an American who made himself into the richest man in Mexico. Driven by a steely desire to prove himself-first to his wife\'s family, then to Mexican elites-William O. Jenkins rose from humble origins in Tennessee to build a business empire in a country energized by industrialization and revolutionary change. In Jenkins of Mexico, Andrew Paxman presents the first biography of this larger-than-life personality. When the decade-long Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, Jenkins preyed on patrician property owners and bought up substantial real estate. He suffered a scare with a firing squad and then a kidnapping by rebels, an episode that almost triggered a US invasion. After the war he owned textile mills, developed Mexico\'s most productive sugar plantation, and helped finance the rise of a major political family, the \xc1vila Camachos. During the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s-50s, he lorded over the film industry with his movie theater monopoly and key role in production. By means of Mexico\'s first major hostile takeover, he bought the country\'s second-largest bank. Reputed as an exploiter of workers, a puppet-master of politicians, and Mexico\'s wealthiest industrialist, Jenkins was the gringo that Mexicans loved to loathe. After his wife\'s death, he embraced philanthropy and willed his entire fortune to a foundation named for her, which co-founded two prestigious universities and funded projects to improve the lives of the poor in his adopted country. Using interviews with Jenkins\' descendants, family papers, and archives in Puebla, Mexico City, Los Angeles, and Washington, Jenkins of Mexico tells a contradictory tale of entrepreneurship and monopoly, fearless individualism and cozy deals with power-brokers, embrace of US-style capitalism and political anti-Americanism, and Mexico\'s transformation from semi-feudal society to emerging economic power. Reviews: "Historian Paxman\'s exhaustive biography of the enigmatic William O. Jenkins reveals that his life had romance, high adventure, mystery, and (movie) magic... [Jenkins of Mexico] is an impressive accomplishment, and readers interested in the evolution of the modern Mexican state will find a fascinating treasure trove here." --Booklist "Researched with care and written with verve, Andrew Paxman\'s highly original study of the long and convoluted life of William Jenkins-entrepreneur, patriarch, philanthropist, and political fixer- is a fascinating read; it also sheds ample light on business and political (mal)practices during the Mexican Revolution and subsequent decades of state-formation and economic growth. For once, a book that manages to combine cogent scholarly research and stylistic flair." --Alan Knight, author of The Mexican Revolution "No one has shown the life of any other US businessman in such engaging detail during these decades. Through Jenkins\'s life Andrew Paxman has been able to show very clearly Mexican political and economic development outside of but impinging on Mexico City." --Linda B. Hall, University of New Mexico "Paxman\'s masterful biography is the story of an enigmatic American in Mexico. Above all, Jenkins of Mexico demonstrates the chameleon-like character of capital\'s-and the capitalist\'s-pursuit of financial and personal rewards wherever they could be found, on farms, in cinema, and in charitable foundations. Given the staggering inequalities of our own times, it\'s a lesson as valuable today as it was during the days of Jenkins." --Geraldo L. Cadava, author of Standing on Common Ground: The Making of a Sunbelt Borderland "A wonderful achievement and a path-breaking example of what good biography can achieve. Andrew Paxman\'s impressively researched study of a hugely influential US businessman is also a rich political and economic history of twentieth-century Mexico. William Jenkins, traditionally caricatured as benevolent hero or imperialist meddler, emerges as a complex and contradictory figure." --Barry Carr, La Trobe University Sponsored by: Department of History; LLILAS Benson; LA Distinguished Speaker Series; Institute for Historical Studies', u'hyperlink': u'https://calendar.utexas.edu/event/talk_crony_capitalism_in_revolutionary_mexico_william_jenkins_symbiotic_imperatives_and_symbiotic_convenience', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-12 16:00:00', u'location': u'Garrison Hall (GAR), 4.100 128 INNER CAMPUS DR , Austin, Texas 78705', u'name': u'\u201cCrony Capitalism in Revolutionary Mexico: William Jenkins, Symbiotic Imperatives, and Symbiotic Convenience,\u201d by Andrew Paxman, Centro de Investigaci\xf3n y Docencia Econ\xf3micas (Mexico City)'}, {u'org_name': u'UT Campus', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Learn more about the Archer Fellowship Program where students can live, learn, and intern in Washington D.C.

Informed by the built environment, her work includes elements of architecture as well as historical references to design, creating imagery that is conversely recognizable and abstract. Her objects extend the two-dimensional format of printmaking into dimensional forms that mirror or respond to shifting observations of physical space. These sculptural forms are surfaced with silkscreen prints of photo-based and handmade patterns, often referencing materials from an urban environment, including stucco, brick, and layers of paint. The sculptures are often incorporated into the process of making etchings and monotypes, working from the forms as models and maquette in the process of making prints. Lauren\u2019s work is deeply invested in the visual vocabulary and history of printmaking and its processes, with themes of reflection, mirroring, repetition, making itself apparent in the graphic language of her work. Lauren Pakradooni is a Philadelphia-based artist and educator. She received a BA from Hampshire College and a MFA in Printmaking from Rhode Island School of Design. Pakradooni is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Art at Hampshire College, where she teaches drawing, sculpture, and printmaking. Her work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions nationally and internationally. She has been awarded fellowships and residencies by the Virginia Commonwealth University Qatar, The Wassaic Project, Women\u2019s Studio Workshop, Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts, and AS220.

"Send a Mayday call all over the world: we are dying here," pleaded Carmen Yul\xedn Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, a week after Category 4 Hurricane Maria barreled across the island and leveled its communications, transportation, waterworks, and energy infrastructure. Her impassioned press conference went viral in global media, provoking an infamous storm of tweets that rebuked her as a "politically motivated ingrate." Since that day, several public officials have acknowledged that local, federal, and international relief efforts are still lagging far behind in coping with the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis affecting Puerto Rico as well as Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, St Martin and St Barts, and Turks and Caicos islands in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Maria. But beyond the immediate human needs, there looms the reality of ecological devastation and economic and political ramifications that could take years to resolve. How did Puerto Rico and other Caribbean countries in distress get to this point? How extensive are the losses and how do we assess them? Has this disaster received appropriate media coverage? What role has the \u201c second-class citizenship" of residents in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Island played in the matter? How have the debt crisis, fiscal austerity measures, a reduced public sector, and an ongoing exodus to the US contributed to make matters worse? To what extent is this disaster natural, and to what extent man-made? How can the Caribbean move forward while confronted by hurricane seasons that seem weaponized by climate change? Four weeks after the landfall of Maria, LLILAS Benson hosts a Foro Urgente to begin addressing these questions. Participants will include current and former faculty members engaged in the study of economics, environment, law, medicine and mental health, media, race, gender, society, culture, and migration in Puerto Rico and throughout the region. Austin community representatives coordinating humanitarian projects for Puerto Rico and neighboring islands will also be there to inform the public of their ongoing relief efforts.

An unclothed, alabaster beauty with dainty wrists bound in chains, Bell\'s sculpture represented a mixed-race slave girl from Louisiana. Like previous nude marble sculptures of lovely female captives, most notably Hiram Powers\'s Greek Slave, The Octoroon ostensibly aimed to inspire Victorian viewers beyond their erotic impulses to the highest echelons of moral and aesthetic contemplation. However, in this case, racial difference made all the difference. The "exotic" racial identity of Bell\'s sculpture--seven parts white, the last eight black--could prompt viewers to read cold, white marble as hot, sensuous flesh! Using Bell\'s Octoroon as a case study but attending to other examples as well, this talk will explore the faddish fascination with beautiful, light-skinned slave girls in British Victorian culture, especially after the abolition of slavery made the political mobilization of such figures moot. Drawn from Dr. Bagneris\u2019s second book, Imagining the Oriental South: The Enslaved Mixed-Race Beauty in British Visual Culture, c. 1865-1880, the talk will also highlight visual and rhetorical echoes between British depictions of antebellum Louisiana and concurrent expressions of Orientalism.', u'hyperlink': u'https://calendar.utexas.edu/event/lecture_series_diaspora_talk_series_-_miscegenation_in_marble_or_the_greek_slaves_dusky_daughter', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-19 16:30:00', u'location': u'Gordon White Building (GWB) 210 24TH ST W, Austin, Texas 78705', u'name': u'Diaspora Talk Series - Miscegenation in Marble, or the Greek Slave\u2019s Dusky Daughter'}, {u'org_name': u'UT Campus', u'verified': 1, u'description': u'Join us for a talk by Amy Hardberger, St. Mary\u2019s University.', u'hyperlink': u'https://calendar.utexas.edu/event/texas_groundwater_law_101_understanding_the_challenges_between_policy_and_science', u'event_id': 0, u'datetime': u'2017-10-19 16:50:00', u'location': u'Jackson Geological Sciences Building (JGB), 2.324 2305 SPEEDWAY , Austin, Texas 78712', u'name': u'Texas Groundwater Law 101: Understanding the Challenges Between Policy and Science'}, {u'org_name': u'UT Campus', u'verified': 1, u'description': u"Join us for this rescheduled event! LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections is pleased to celebrate the opening of Deudos / Death Debt: The Art of Eduardo Lalo, an exhibition of black-and-white photographs by the acclaimed Puerto Rican writer and visual artist Eduardo Lalo. The event includes a conversation, with remarks by the artist, at 4:00 p.m., followed by a reception. Lalo's photographs illustrate the increasing vulnerabilities and anxieties of Puerto Ricans affected by the Commonwealth's deepening debt crisis. Now, in the wake of Hurricane Maria's devastation, this exhibition takes on even more urgency. Deudos / Death Debt not only exhibits a topical selection of Lalo\u2019s distinctively trenchant visual work and graphics. It also opens a unique window that makes fully visible the ruinous economic, political, and social dispossession that Puerto Ricans continue to suffer at this crucial moment. A selection of Lalo's drawings and published works will also be on display. Along with Eduardo Lalo, Puerto Rican scholars C\xe9sar A. Salgado and Jossianna Arroyo-Mart\xednez (both of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese) will assess, discuss, and rethink the visual politics and critical representations that the works in Deudos / Death Debt propose about the island's inhabitants under oppressive debt before Hurricane Maria from the vantage point of the images of a fully devastated island currently circulating in global media. Lalo will field questions from the audience following the conversation. Free and open to the public. For more information, contact Susanna Sharpe at 512.232.2403.

About Daniel Quiles Daniel Quiles is an Assistant Professor of Art History, Theory, and Criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he teaches courses on the theory and history of postwar art of the Americas. His research has appeared in academic journals such as Art Journal and ARTMargins, and he is currently writing a book manuscript titled Ghost Messages: Oscar Masotta and Argentine Conceptualism. He is also an art critic who has written for Artforum, Art in America, and DIS Magazine, among other publications. About Jaime Davidovich Jaime Davidovich (1935-2016), was a New York-based video and installation who, before many others, recognized the emergence of cable TV in the 1970s as a polymorphous medium that could serve artists\u2014and viewers\u2014in extraordinary ways. Davidovich was born in Buenos Aires. He studied at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, the University of Uruguay, and New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts. Prior to video and television, Davidovich was a painter, exploring all the material and philosophical aspects surrounding the monochrome, which led to more expansive works investigating ephemerality and site-specificity. He moved to New York in 1964, and in 1976, helped found Cable SoHo and, in 1978, founded and was president of the Artists\u2019 Television Network. These platforms for the distribution of avant-garde thinking and programming via cable access was a way of \u201cget[ting] out of the claustrophobic traditional art world,\u201d Davidovich told the New York Times in 1979. He was also the creator of Cable Soho\u2019s The Live! Show, a variety half-hour hosted by the artist\u2019s alter ego \u201cDr. Videovich,\u201d that ran from 1979 to 1984. The Live! Show owed as much to Ed Sullivan and Ernie Kovacs as it did to Dada and Situationism, and featured projects and performances from a wide range of makers and personalities, such as Laurie Anderson, Eric Bogosian, Mike Smith, Tony Oursler, Tim Maul, Walter Robinson, Linda Montano, Ann Magnuson, and Richard Hell.

From the speaker: Speciesism, the according of different rights to individuals based on their species, and the exclusion of other animals from the rights, freedoms, and protections afforded to humans, is the accepted norm today. How will people in a 100 years look back on our practices? We kill about 150 billion animals \u2013 20 times the entire human population \u2013 every year. I propose that the alternative is easier than you think, and comes with many other positive effects. So please join me to discuss the future of our food! There will be coffee and doughnuts. About the speaker: Emanuel grew up close to Frankfurt, Germany, and researches Biophysics at UT. He listens to the Austin Symphony and dances to European techno.

Using immigraton interviews, legal cases, and social work files, the paper highlights the different ways co-ethnic attorneys and advocates, immigraton officials and judges, and Jewish and Armenian women migrants represented wartime and postwar refugee experiences. Yael Schacher received her Ph.D. in American Studies from Harvard in 2016. Her dissertation, \u201cExceptions to Exclusion: A Prehistory of Asylum in the United States, 1880-1980,\u201d traced the relationship of U.S. immigration restriction to refugee policy over the course of the twentieth century, examining the handling of claims for refuge by political exiles, war widows and orphans, deserting seamen, and stranded students. This examination highlighted both important precedents for, and paths not taken in, the contemporary American asylum system (established in law in 1980). In Fall 2016, Yael received a Cromwell Foundation early career fellowship through the American Society for Legal History to support revisions of her dissertation for publication. Yael has published essays and reviews on ethnic literature and immigration history, most recently a chapter in American Literature in Transition: The 1930s (Cambridge University Press) analyzing diversity and multiculturalism in American literature at a time of restrictionist and exclusionary immigration policy. Yael was a research assistant for Harvard Library\'s digital archives on immigration to the US, and, from 2012 through 2017, she made immigration a focus of her American Studies courses at the University of Connecticut. She is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Historical Studies at the University of Texas at Austin in 2017-2018.

After the literary strata of Ezra 7-10 and Nehemiah 8-10 are identified, what emerges as the Ezra Memoir is an account of Ezra\u2019s leadership of the returnees from Babylonia over a period of a single year. Inspired by the multiple representations of the Israelite wilderness in the Pentateuch, the Ezra Memoir may be understood as a \u2018super-narrative\u2019 that utilizes its source materials to present the Babylonian returnees as the true inheritors of the Yahvistic cult. This talk will revisit the so-called mixed marriages episode in Ezra 9-10 with the aim to revive arguments for its literary coherency, understand how Ezra resolves the conflicting interests among the stakeholders in the community, and explore how this episode understands and expands upon \u2018biblical jurisprudence\u2019. Although a troubling text for many modern readers, this episode addresses real\u2014and envisioned\u2014social, political, and religious concerns within Second Temple Judaism.

From the petrophysics perspective some key words are: net height or pay, drainage area, porosity, hydrocarbon saturation, and recovery factor in conventional plays.

He obtained a B.S. in Electronic Engineering from Universidad Simon Bolivar (Venezuela), and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Petroleum Engineering from Louisiana State University. Dr. Quintero started his career in 1984 as a wireline engineer in India (offshore and onshore). He later advanced to positions in petrophysics, reservoir engineering, business development, financial analysis, project management and production management.

We are instructed to notice thoughts as they arise so that we can return to our sensory awareness. Despite the incrediblely useful nature of this approach, at times it can become cumbersome. We can have the best of both worlds by noticing that thoughts are existing, returning to our bodies, and then re-examining what hooked us in in the first place. From this point of view we can look into our thoughts and see that the hook was actually never an inherent aspect of our thinking mind.

FROM PROFESSOR JULIE IRWIN\u2014 I\u2019m both a consumer and a researcher, and I\u2019m fascinated by the fact that what I actually care about isn\u2019t always reflected in my purchasing behavior. From a rational economics perspective, the fact that people don\u2019t pay close attention to moral issues when they shop might suggest that people are actually terrible, immoral creatures \u2014 but I disagree. I will show that there are many reasons for this lack of consistency. I will draw from my field of behavioral economics as well as my own research to discuss larger themes around ethical consumerism. I hope I can help attendees make decisions that better align with what they care about. WHAT YOU WILL LEARN \u2022 Why people\u2019s economic behavior can be different from what they actually care about \u2022 Specific aspects of consumer situations that can lead consumers to be \u201cbad\u201d \u2022 How to better align purchasing with values, as a consumer \u2022 How corporate marketers, non-profits, and political organizations can help guide people toward expressing their ethical values CPE CREDIT OFFERED SHORT BIO Julie Irwin is the Marlene and Morton Meyerson Centennial Professor of Business in the Business, Government and Society Department.

The history of the origins of this famine is still shrouded in mystery. For the most part, social science literature has represented the famine as being the product of Mao's Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958 and ended in 1962. In this talk, I will explain how the great famine was more the product of a long term state policy of procurement, and also how Mao Zedong initiated and pushed this policy well before the event of the Great Leap Forward, eventually inducing the great famine. Bringing the role of state procurement back into the debate over the great famine's causality, my analysis will shed new light on the under appreciated temporal development of the famine. It will demonstrate that the political and social disaster of 1958-1962 was rooted in Mao's relentless and ruthless attempt to build a new socialist political order by intentionally exploiting farm households, a process that produced record procurement of harvests well before 1958 and that eventually turned a widening, intensifying subsistence crisis into a procurement famine of unprecedented scale. The talk will take up issues of suffering and resistance to the politics driving this famine, and also will open a new window on whom rural people blamed for the famine.

Sonner, co-curators of the current \u201cFrom Commemoration to Education: Pompeo Coppini\u2019s Status of Jefferson Davis\u201d exhibition at the Dolph Briscoe for American History. Wright and Sonner will provide a brief overview of the educational and professional experiences that brought them to the Briscoe Center before discussing their unique interpretive approach to curating the Briscoe\u2019s Jefferson Davis statue exhibit. In the process, Wright and Sonner carefully considered different approaches and interpretive materials, selecting those they felt would elicit and answer important questions, enhance the visitor experience, and ultimately focus on the history of the statue itself as an object, instead of Davis\u2019 role in the Confederacy or the debate surrounding the statue\u2019s removal from its former prominent post on UT\u2019s South Mall. Commissioned in 1919 by university regent Major George W. Littlefield, the statue was envisioned as part of a much larger allegorical memorial, the Littlefield Fountain, intended to honor Texans who died in the Civil War and World War I while also addressing the reconciliation of the northern and southern states between those wars. However, the memorial and its campus setting and cultural context changed significantly over the course of its development. No longer an object of commemoration, the statue was moved in 2015 and now forms part of the Briscoe\u2019s new exhibition that explores the statue's history, as well as its significance as both a work of art and evidence of the past. Ben Wright is the Briscoe Center\u2019s Associate Director for Communications. Prior to joining the center, he worked as a reporter covering the 2008 general election in New Mexico and the 2009 Texas legislative session in Austin. Later he worked as a Communications Director in both the Texas House and Senate. Wright earned an MA in Modern History from King\u2019s College London. He hopes to pursue a PhD in the future, with his primary research interest being Texas between the Civil War and World War I. His personal writing on focuses on history, curation, travel, and faith. Dr. Sarah Sonner is the Briscoe\u2019s Assistant Director for Exhibits Curation. She has held research and curatorial positions at a number of distinguished institutions including London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum, the American Philosophical Society Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. As a curator, she has researched and developed exhibits and interpretive materials on a wide variety of topics ranging from American bootleg moonshine to Brazilian religious tradition and ritual. Sonner holds a doctorate in Cultural Studies from Goldsmiths College, University of London, an MA in 20th Century Literature from King\u2019s College, University of London, and an MFA in Writing from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

In the United States, the problem of crime has been framed as the problem of the criminal, but as social workers we know that crime and violence are the consequences of the complex interaction between persons and their environments, as well as the choices of our collective society as to who and how to punish. Mass incarceration has been thoroughly explored as a racial, social and economic project. Viewed through a psychoanalytic lens, another dimension becomes visible: the ways in which the dehumanization and criminalization of certain members of society forces them to function as repositories for the unbearable aspects of our otherwise shared humanity. In this presentation, the relationship between trauma, violence and mass incarceration will be explored from a psychoanalytic perspective. Using the concept of projective identification, we can consider the ways in which abandoning people to traumatogenic conditions and criminalizing their responses to them enables the logic of mass incarceration by taking a problem in the environment \u2014 one that implicates the collective \u2014 and relocating it to inside the individual \u2014 a person to be punished. The implications for social work practice, policy and for social justice will also be discussed. Elizabeth Kita received her PhD in clinical social work from Smith College\u2019s School of Social Work in 2012, after many years of clinical practice in a variety of settings: with children and families in their homes, a community outpatient clinic, a state prison, the department of parole, a psychodynamic psychotherapy clinic, and in private practice. She discovered psychodynamic theory along the way, and found it to be the most humanizing lens through which to understand people and their problems. In addition to practicing as a clinical social worker, Kita is a lecturer at UC Berkeley, and provides clinical supervision to licensed and unlicensed clinicians.

The Soils and Geomorphology Lab at UT Austin in Geography acquired nearly 300 square km of LiDAR imagery that covers large areas of ancient Maya wetland fields and many reservoirs for the first time. The coverage indicates both wide-scale wetland canal and field systems, water management, and intensive, polycultural complexes of upland terraces and wetland fields. Over the last 15 years, we tested many such systems with excavations and multiple proxies for past formation and cultivation. But, the LiDAR imagery shows we studied only a small spatial sample of these systems. We present what we now know based on excavations from Lamanai to Sierra de Agua, and use the Li \u200bDAR\u200b imagery to outline our future plan to obtain a more geographically representative \u200b \u200b sample. Our goal here is to contextualize wetland agriculture and water management both diachronically and synchronically within Maya History. Timothy Beach holds The C.B. Smith, Sr. Centennial Chair in United States - Mexico Relations #2 and directs the Soils and Geoarchaeology Lab in Geography at the University of Texas at Austin. For twenty-one years, he taught at Georgetown University, where he held the Cinco Hermanos Chair and was Professor of Geography and Geoscience and Director of the STIA and Environmental Studies Programs. He has conducted field research on soils, geomorphology, paleoecology, wetlands, and geoarchaeology in the Corn Belt of the United States, Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Syria, Turkey, Iceland, Colombia, Italy, and Germany funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Geographic Society, USAID, The University of Texas at Austin, and Georgetown University.

Lake merges regional and environmental design to create site sensitive, distinctive architecture. As an architect, contractor and developer, he has broad experience in the built environment. Lake believes architecture must \u201cfit\u201d environmentally and contextually, molding our built traditions while looking toward future solutions, and connecting us to our place through the careful stewardship of our natural resources. Lake has a long-term commitment to sustainable design. For four years, he served as a board member of the Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems. He is also a longtime member of the American Solar Energy Society and has served as the Chairman of the Texas AIA Natural Resources Committee. A longtime advocate for development that both conserves our natural resources and creates contextually relevant architecture, Lake helped found the Coalition for Smart Growth, the Master Plan, and a Downtown Revitalization Plan for San Antonio. Furthermore, he developed San Antonio\u2019s Southside Initiative, Austin\u2019s Historic Zoning Ordinance, and Austin\u2019s Bicentennial Greenbelt Plan. Beyond ongoing downtown redevelopment projects in San Antonio, he is involved in urban design projects from Florida to California.

What\'s more, though African Americans and Hispanics only make up approximately 32% of the U.S. population, they comprised 56% of all incarcerated people in 2015. And although African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites. The public forum will begin at 6PM in the Avaya Auditorium with a screening Ava DuVernay\'s award-winning documentary 13th, which examines this intersection of race and mass incarceration in the U.S. in order to argue that slavery has been perpetuated through North America\'s prison system. Nominated for the Academy Award and winner of a Peabody Award as well as the BAFTA for Best Documentary, Ava DuVernay\'s 13TH is one of the most critically-acclaimed films of 2016. Watch the trailer here! Following the screening will be a panel discussion and Q&A featuring a Criminal Justice Organizer from Grassroots Leadership and UT faculty.

Mavor takes special interest in the fairy tale\u2019s gastronomy, including Alice\u2019s Wonderland cake marked eat me, the sugar of the witch\u2019s house in "Hansel and Gretel" and the more disturbing ingestions of cannibalism, as in the Brothers Grimm\u2019s "The Juniper Tree", where a murdered boy sings through the mouth of a bird: "My mother she killed me. My father he ate me." Moving beyond this, Mavor discovers the fairy-tale realm in more surprising places: the tragic candy-land poetry of the 1950s "genius" child-poet Minou Drouet; the subterranean world of enchantment in the cave paintings of Lascaux; the brown fairies of African American poet Langston Hughes; and Miwa Yanagi\u2019s black-and-white, bloody photograph of the Grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood holding one another in the cut open belly of the wolf, as an allegory of the victims of Hiroshima. Through the lens of the fairy tale Mavor reads the world of literature and art as both magical and political. Carol Mavor is Professor of Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Manchester, England. As a writer who takes creative risks in form (literary and experimental) and political risks in content (sexuality, racial hatred, child-loving and the maternal), she has published widely on photography, cinema, colour and childhood. All her books, including Blue Mythologies: Reflections on a Colour (Reaktion, 2013), are richly illustrated with an eye on design.

In this seminar, two presenters probe contemporary questions about the nature of the political through the lens of the ancient India. Renowned political theorist Rajeev Bhargava will explore pluralism in time of Ashoka (3rd cent. BCE) for insights into the theoretical problem of studying concepts from the ancient world in relation to modern political vocabulary and the practical challenge of taking ancient political ideas seriously. Indologist and religious historian Timothy Lubin in turn will describe his groundbreaking recent work on diplomatics (especially epigraphical documents) in ancient India in relation to patterns of patronage and political ideals that transcend the state. From these different starting points, this seminar invites us to work both backward and forward in time as we seek to develop a richer understanding of India\u2019s political history and its contributions to political theory.

Brown, Department of History, presents his new book, Cuba\u2019s Revolutionary World. Professor Kurt Weyland, Department of Government, participates as discussant. On January 2, 1959, Fidel Castro, the rebel comandante who had just overthrown Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, addressed a crowd of jubilant supporters. Recalling the failed popular uprisings of past decades, Castro assured them that this time "the real Revolution" had arrived. As Brown shows in this capacious history of the Cuban Revolution, Castro\'s words proved prophetic not only for his countrymen but for Latin America and the wider world. Cuba\'s Revolutionary World examines in forensic detail how the turmoil that rocked a small Caribbean nation in the 1950s became one of the twentieth century\'s most transformative events. Initially, Castro\'s revolution augured well for democratic reform movements gaining traction in Latin America. But what had begun promisingly veered off course as Castro took a heavy hand in efforts to centralize Cuba\'s economy and stamp out private enterprise. Embracing the Soviet Union as an ally, Castro and his lieutenant Che Guevara sought to export the socialist revolution abroad through armed insurrection. Castro\'s provocations inspired intense opposition. Cuban anticommunists who had fled to Miami found a patron in the CIA, which actively supported their efforts to topple Castro\'s regime. The unrest fomented by Cuban-trained leftist guerrillas lent support to Latin America\'s military castes, who promised to restore stability. Brazil was the first to succumb to a coup in 1964; a decade later, military juntas governed most Latin American states. Thus did a revolution that had seemed to signal the death knell of dictatorship in Latin America bring about its tragic opposite. Free and open to the public.

Dr. Salviander converted from atheism to Christianity while studying for her doctorate, in large part because of the compelling evidence for God she observed through her scientific work. This inspired Dr. Salviander and her husband, Sami, to start a ministry to spread the message that modern science affirms Christian belief. Sarah Salviander, PhD, is a research scientist in the field of astrophysics and a visiting professor of physics. Her research interests are nature\u2019s most extreme objects: quasars and supermassive black holes. Dr. Salviander grew up in the wild Crown Lands of Northern British Columbia, Canada, in a family of American expats. She developed a strong interest in studying space at a young age, but once she realized she wasn\u2019t cut out for life as an astronaut, she decided to explore the universe through science. Dr. Salviander received her Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Texas at Austin, and has numerous journal and conference publications to her name.

Drawing on more than 250 interviews from people affected by, and involved with, prostitution around the world\u2014from trafficked women to legal brothel owners\u2014Bindel paints a global picture of the lived realities of women that is essential in navigating the current political and moral debates. Bindel is a freelance journalist who writes regularly for The Guardian and appears frequently on the BBC and Sky News. She has been active in the global campaign to end violence against women and children since 1979; is a founder of the UK group Justice for Women; and is a member of the board of SPACE, an international organization formed to give voice to women who have survived prostitution.

However, in China, purple is often thought to have been relatively unimportant because it was not one of the five colors and was famously reviled by Confucius. Purple\u2019s eventual popularity with Emperor Wu (r. 141-87 BCE) of the Han dynasty has often been attributed to the color\u2019s association with Daoism. This presentation will re-examine the status of purple in ancient China and propose that by the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) if not earlier, purple had assumed the same status that it had in other parts of the ancient world\u2014as the ultimate sign of royal or imperial authority. Examining new evidence from archaeology, I will analyze the sources of purple dye in ancient China, presenting new evidence that the Chinese may have used dyes extracted from shellfish (often loosely referred to as \u201cmurex purple\u201d) rather than zicao (gromwell) as has been previously assumed. I will also show that purple textiles had a longstanding relationship with Shandong province, particularly the ancient city of Linzi. The popularity of purple fabrics produced in this region fueled demand for the color in other media, catalyzing the development of paints colored with synthetic purple pigments. Allison R. Miller (Ph.D., Harvard University) is an assistant professor of Asian art history at Southwestern University, specializing in the art and archaeology of early China. Her research focuses on ritual architecture, court art (early Chinese jades, terracotta figurines), gifting and patronage, ornament, and early aesthetic theory.
