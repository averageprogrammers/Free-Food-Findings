This activity represents an important shift from the top-down model of university degrees to a learner-generated, micro-credentialing \u201cbottom-up\u201d model. How will the research community respond to help ensure that technology-mediated instruction at scale continues to be more learner-focused and community enhanced? What work can we initiate or surface that allows for underserved learners to benefit from more accessible opportunities for career advancement? How can we create the kind of socially supportive online contexts that are conducive for career development, especially for the underserved? And what resources might make this more possible?

Despite this vaunted place in the country\u2019s postwar art history, it is commonly characterized as promoting a rationalist, stringent practice of geometric abstraction and unfavorably contrasted to the more intuitive and expansive approach of Rio de Janeiro\u2013based abstract artists in what became Neo-Concretism\u2014the movement, launched in 1959, that has received more attention than any other of Brazil\u2019s contributions to contemporary art. In this talk, Assistant Professor of Art and Art History Adele Nelson asserts that the crux of Grupo Ruptura\u2019s approach entailed the conception of art as a form of knowledge and social relation more so than a claim to stylistic unity or hard-and-fast antagonism to figuration. The group\u2019s leader, artist and critic Waldemar Cordeiro, was, along with critic M\xe1rio Pedrosa, one of abstraction\u2019s most significant interpreters in Brazil in the decade following World War II. Nelson analyzes the parallels Cordeiro constructed between non-representational abstraction and day-to-day, material reality, and his criticisms of the private, exclusionary nature of the new modern art institutions in Brazil in relationship to his engagement with the discourses of Marxism and formalist art theory. Adele Nelson is assistant professor in the Department of Art and Art History at The University of Texas at Austin.

Crew Distinguished Teaching Professor of History, University of Texas at Austin Dr. Crew's faculty profile page Bodies and Ruins explores changing German memories of World War II as it analyzes the construction of narratives in the postwar period including the depiction of the bombing of individual German cities. The book offers a corrective notion rising in the late 1990s notion that discussions of the Allied bombing were long overdue, because Germans who had endured the bombings had largely been condemned to silence after 1945. David Crew shows that far from being marginalized in postwar historical consciousness, the bombing war was in fact a central strand of German memory and identity. Local narratives of the bombing war, including photographic books, had already established themselves as important \u201cvectors of memory\u201d in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The bombing war had allowed Germans to see themselves as victims at a time when the Allied liberation of the concentration camps and the Nuremberg trials presented Germans to the world as perpetrators or at least as accomplices. The bombing war continued to serve this function even as Germans became more and more willing directly to confront the genocide of European Jews\u2014which by the 1960s was beginning to be referred to as the Holocaust. Bodies and Ruins examines a range of local publications that carried photographic images of German cities destroyed in the air war, images that soon entered the visual memory of World War II. Despite its obvious importance, historians have paid very little attention to the visual representation of the bombing war. This book follows the search for what were considered to be the \u201cright\u201d stories and the \u201cright\u201d pictures of the bombing war in local publications and picture books from 1945 to the present, and is intended for historians as well as general readers interested in World War II, the Allied bombing of German cities, the Holocaust, the history of memory and photographic/visual history. \u201cSmart, thought-provoking, engaging, and important. The topic of the bombing war has moved to center stage in discussions of how best to remember and commemorate the end of the Second World War in Germany, but we know very little about the ways in which \u201cbodies and ruins\u201d\u2014the causalities of the bombing war\u2014were remembered in the fifty years or so after 1945.

Dr. Paxman, who earned his Ph.D. in Latin American History in 2009 at The University of Texas at Austin, is the co-author of El Tigre: Emilio Azc\xe1rraga y su imperio Televisa, a biography of the Mexican media mogul Emilio Azc\xe1rraga Milmo. Read about Dr. Paxman and his work at: https://andrewpaxman.wordpress.com/. To RSVP, Please email cmeador@austin.utexas.edu by Monday, Oct 9. About Jenkins of Mexico: In the city of Puebla there lived an American who made himself into the richest man in Mexico. Driven by a steely desire to prove himself-first to his wife\'s family, then to Mexican elites-William O. Jenkins rose from humble origins in Tennessee to build a business empire in a country energized by industrialization and revolutionary change. In Jenkins of Mexico, Andrew Paxman presents the first biography of this larger-than-life personality. When the decade-long Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, Jenkins preyed on patrician property owners and bought up substantial real estate. He suffered a scare with a firing squad and then a kidnapping by rebels, an episode that almost triggered a US invasion. After the war he owned textile mills, developed Mexico\'s most productive sugar plantation, and helped finance the rise of a major political family, the \xc1vila Camachos. During the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s-50s, he lorded over the film industry with his movie theater monopoly and key role in production. By means of Mexico\'s first major hostile takeover, he bought the country\'s second-largest bank. Reputed as an exploiter of workers, a puppet-master of politicians, and Mexico\'s wealthiest industrialist, Jenkins was the gringo that Mexicans loved to loathe. After his wife\'s death, he embraced philanthropy and willed his entire fortune to a foundation named for her, which co-founded two prestigious universities and funded projects to improve the lives of the poor in his adopted country. Using interviews with Jenkins\' descendants, family papers, and archives in Puebla, Mexico City, Los Angeles, and Washington, Jenkins of Mexico tells a contradictory tale of entrepreneurship and monopoly, fearless individualism and cozy deals with power-brokers, embrace of US-style capitalism and political anti-Americanism, and Mexico\'s transformation from semi-feudal society to emerging economic power. Reviews: "Historian Paxman\'s exhaustive biography of the enigmatic William O. Jenkins reveals that his life had romance, high adventure, mystery, and (movie) magic... [Jenkins of Mexico] is an impressive accomplishment, and readers interested in the evolution of the modern Mexican state will find a fascinating treasure trove here." --Booklist "Researched with care and written with verve, Andrew Paxman\'s highly original study of the long and convoluted life of William Jenkins-entrepreneur, patriarch, philanthropist, and political fixer- is a fascinating read; it also sheds ample light on business and political (mal)practices during the Mexican Revolution and subsequent decades of state-formation and economic growth. For once, a book that manages to combine cogent scholarly research and stylistic flair." --Alan Knight, author of The Mexican Revolution "No one has shown the life of any other US businessman in such engaging detail during these decades. Through Jenkins\'s life Andrew Paxman has been able to show very clearly Mexican political and economic development outside of but impinging on Mexico City." --Linda B. Hall, University of New Mexico "Paxman\'s masterful biography is the story of an enigmatic American in Mexico. Above all, Jenkins of Mexico demonstrates the chameleon-like character of capital\'s-and the capitalist\'s-pursuit of financial and personal rewards wherever they could be found, on farms, in cinema, and in charitable foundations. Given the staggering inequalities of our own times, it\'s a lesson as valuable today as it was during the days of Jenkins." --Geraldo L. Cadava, author of Standing on Common Ground: The Making of a Sunbelt Borderland "A wonderful achievement and a path-breaking example of what good biography can achieve. Andrew Paxman\'s impressively researched study of a hugely influential US businessman is also a rich political and economic history of twentieth-century Mexico. William Jenkins, traditionally caricatured as benevolent hero or imperialist meddler, emerges as a complex and contradictory figure." --Barry Carr, La Trobe University Sponsored by: Department of History; LLILAS Benson; LA Distinguished Speaker Series; Institute for Historical Studies', 'hyperlink': u'https://calendar.utexas.edu/event/talk_crony_capitalism_in_revolutionary_mexico_william_jenkins_symbiotic_imperatives_and_symbiotic_convenience', 'event_id': 0, 'datetime': '2017-10-12 16:00:00', 'location': u'Garrison Hall (GAR), 4.100 128 INNER CAMPUS DR , Austin, Texas 78705', 'name': u'\u201cCrony Capitalism in Revolutionary Mexico: William Jenkins, Symbiotic Imperatives, and Symbiotic Convenience,\u201d by Andrew Paxman, Centro de Investigaci\xf3n y Docencia Econ\xf3micas (Mexico City)'}, {'org_name': 'UT Campus', 'verified': 1, 'description': u'Achievement in academics and the workplace both begin with the basics: plenty of sleep, nutritious meals, a balance of work and play, and useful stress-reducing strategies.

Informed by the built environment, her work includes elements of architecture as well as historical references to design, creating imagery that is conversely recognizable and abstract. Her objects extend the two-dimensional format of printmaking into dimensional forms that mirror or respond to shifting observations of physical space. These sculptural forms are surfaced with silkscreen prints of photo-based and handmade patterns, often referencing materials from an urban environment, including stucco, brick, and layers of paint. The sculptures are often incorporated into the process of making etchings and monotypes, working from the forms as models and maquette in the process of making prints. Lauren\u2019s work is deeply invested in the visual vocabulary and history of printmaking and its processes, with themes of reflection, mirroring, repetition, making itself apparent in the graphic language of her work. Lauren Pakradooni is a Philadelphia-based artist and educator. She received a BA from Hampshire College and a MFA in Printmaking from Rhode Island School of Design. Pakradooni is a Visiting Assistant Professor of Art at Hampshire College, where she teaches drawing, sculpture, and printmaking. Her work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions nationally and internationally.

"Send a Mayday call all over the world: we are dying here," pleaded Carmen Yul\xedn Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, a week after Category 4 Hurricane Maria barreled across the island and leveled its communications, transportation, waterworks, and energy infrastructure. Her impassioned press conference went viral in global media, provoking an infamous storm of tweets that rebuked her as a "politically motivated ingrate." Since that day, several public officials have acknowledged that local, federal, and international relief efforts are still lagging far behind in coping with the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis affecting Puerto Rico as well as Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, St Martin and St Barts, and Turks and Caicos islands in the wake of hurricanes Irma and Maria. But beyond the immediate human needs, there looms the reality of ecological devastation and economic and political ramifications that could take years to resolve. How did Puerto Rico and other Caribbean countries in distress get to this point? How extensive are the losses and how do we assess them? Has this disaster received appropriate media coverage? What role has the \u201c second-class citizenship" of residents in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Island played in the matter? How have the debt crisis, fiscal austerity measures, a reduced public sector, and an ongoing exodus to the US contributed to make matters worse? To what extent is this disaster natural, and to what extent man-made? How can the Caribbean move forward while confronted by hurricane seasons that seem weaponized by climate change? Four weeks after the landfall of Maria, LLILAS Benson hosts a Foro Urgente to begin addressing these questions. Participants will include current and former faculty members engaged in the study of economics, environment, law, medicine and mental health, media, race, gender, society, culture, and migration in Puerto Rico and throughout the region. Austin community representatives coordinating humanitarian projects for Puerto Rico and neighboring islands will also be there to inform the public of their ongoing relief efforts.

LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections is pleased to celebrate the opening of Deudos / Death Debt: The Art of Eduardo Lalo, an exhibition of black-and-white photographs by the acclaimed Puerto Rican writer and visual artist Eduardo Lalo. The event includes a conversation, with remarks by the artist, at 4:00 p.m., followed by a reception. Lalo's photographs illustrate the increasing vulnerabilities and anxieties of Puerto Ricans affected by the Commonwealth's deepening debt crisis. Now, in the wake of Hurricane Maria's devastation, this exhibition takes on even more urgency. Deudos / Death Debt not only exhibits a topical selection of Lalo\u2019s distinctively trenchant visual work and graphics. It also opens a unique window that makes fully visible the ruinous economic, political, and social dispossession that Puerto Ricans continue to suffer at this crucial moment. A selection of Lalo's drawings and published works will also be on display. Along with Eduardo Lalo, Puerto Rican scholars C\xe9sar A. Salgado and Jossianna Arroyo-Mart\xednez (both of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese) will assess, discuss, and rethink the visual politics and critical representations that the works in Deudos / Death Debt propose about the island's inhabitants under oppressive debt before Hurricane Maria from the vantage point of the images of a fully devastated island currently circulating in global media. Lalo will field questions from the audience following the conversation. Free and open to the public. For more information, contact Susanna Sharpe at 512.232.2403.

About Daniel Quiles Daniel Quiles is an Assistant Professor of Art History, Theory, and Criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he teaches courses on the theory and history of postwar art of the Americas. His research has appeared in academic journals such as Art Journal and ARTMargins, and he is currently writing a book manuscript titled Ghost Messages: Oscar Masotta and Argentine Conceptualism. He is also an art critic who has written for Artforum, Art in America, and DIS Magazine, among other publications. About Jaime Davidovich Jaime Davidovich (1935-2016), was a New York-based video and installation who, before many others, recognized the emergence of cable TV in the 1970s as a polymorphous medium that could serve artists\u2014and viewers\u2014in extraordinary ways. Davidovich was born in Buenos Aires. He studied at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, the University of Uruguay, and New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts. Prior to video and television, Davidovich was a painter, exploring all the material and philosophical aspects surrounding the monochrome, which led to more expansive works investigating ephemerality and site-specificity. He moved to New York in 1964, and in 1976, helped found Cable SoHo and, in 1978, founded and was president of the Artists\u2019 Television Network. These platforms for the distribution of avant-garde thinking and programming via cable access was a way of \u201cget[ting] out of the claustrophobic traditional art world,\u201d Davidovich told the New York Times in 1979. He was also the creator of Cable Soho\u2019s The Live! Show, a variety half-hour hosted by the artist\u2019s alter ego \u201cDr. Videovich,\u201d that ran from 1979 to 1984. The Live! Show owed as much to Ed Sullivan and Ernie Kovacs as it did to Dada and Situationism, and featured projects and performances from a wide range of makers and personalities, such as Laurie Anderson, Eric Bogosian, Mike Smith, Tony Oursler, Tim Maul, Walter Robinson, Linda Montano, Ann Magnuson, and Richard Hell.

Using immigraton interviews, legal cases, and social work files, the paper highlights the different ways co-ethnic attorneys and advocates, immigraton officials and judges, and Jewish and Armenian women migrants represented wartime and postwar refugee experiences. Yael Schacher received her Ph.D. in American Studies from Harvard in 2016. Her dissertation, \u201cExceptions to Exclusion: A Prehistory of Asylum in the United States, 1880-1980,\u201d traced the relationship of U.S. immigration restriction to refugee policy over the course of the twentieth century, examining the handling of claims for refuge by political exiles, war widows and orphans, deserting seamen, and stranded students. This examination highlighted both important precedents for, and paths not taken in, the contemporary American asylum system (established in law in 1980). In Fall 2016, Yael received a Cromwell Foundation early career fellowship through the American Society for Legal History to support revisions of her dissertation for publication. Yael has published essays and reviews on ethnic literature and immigration history, most recently a chapter in American Literature in Transition: The 1930s (Cambridge University Press) analyzing diversity and multiculturalism in American literature at a time of restrictionist and exclusionary immigration policy. Yael was a research assistant for Harvard Library\'s digital archives on immigration to the US, and, from 2012 through 2017, she made immigration a focus of her American Studies courses at the University of Connecticut. She is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Historical Studies at the University of Texas at Austin in 2017-2018.

We are instructed to notice thoughts as they arise so that we can return to our sensory awareness. Despite the incrediblely useful nature of this approach, at times it can become cumbersome. We can have the best of both worlds by noticing that thoughts are existing, returning to our bodies, and then re-examining what hooked us in in the first place. From this point of view we can look into our thoughts and see that the hook was actually never an inherent aspect of our thinking mind.

They give to charity, help their neighbors, love their children. And if you ask them if they\u2019re comfortable with sweatshops, child labor, or animal testing, it\u2019s no surprise most will say they\u2019re not. But our desire to be ethical and to \u201cdo good\u201d is very often at odds with our desire to get exactly what we want, cheaply and quickly. Behavioral economist and researcher Julie Irwin, a professor at the McCombs School of Business, will explore consumer behavioral patterns to help expose some of the reasons why people\u2019s buying habits often don\u2019t align with their values. FROM PROFESSOR JULIE IRWIN\u2014 I\u2019m both a consumer and a researcher, and I\u2019m fascinated by the fact that what I actually care about isn\u2019t always reflected in my purchasing behavior. From a rational economics perspective, the fact that people don\u2019t pay close attention to moral issues when they shop might suggest that people are actually terrible, immoral creatures \u2014 but I disagree.

The history of the origins of this famine is still shrouded in mystery. For the most part, social science literature has represented the famine as being the product of Mao's Great Leap Forward, which began in 1958 and ended in 1962. In this talk, I will explain how the great famine was more the product of a long term state policy of procurement, and also how Mao Zedong initiated and pushed this policy well before the event of the Great Leap Forward, eventually inducing the great famine. Bringing the role of state procurement back into the debate over the great famine's causality, my analysis will shed new light on the under appreciated temporal development of the famine. It will demonstrate that the political and social disaster of 1958-1962 was rooted in Mao's relentless and ruthless attempt to build a new socialist political order by intentionally exploiting farm households, a process that produced record procurement of harvests well before 1958 and that eventually turned a widening, intensifying subsistence crisis into a procurement famine of unprecedented scale. The talk will take up issues of suffering and resistance to the politics driving this famine, and also will open a new window on whom rural people blamed for the famine.

The Soils and Geomorphology Lab at UT Austin in Geography acquired nearly 300 square km of LiDAR imagery that covers large areas of ancient Maya wetland fields and many reservoirs for the first time. The coverage indicates both wide-scale wetland canal and field systems, water management, and intensive, polycultural complexes of upland terraces and wetland fields. Over the last 15 years, we tested many such systems with excavations and multiple proxies for past formation and cultivation. But, the LiDAR imagery shows we studied only a small spatial sample of these systems. We present what we now know based on excavations from Lamanai to Sierra de Agua, and use the Li \u200bDAR\u200b imagery to outline our future plan to obtain a more geographically representative \u200b \u200b sample. Our goal here is to contextualize wetland agriculture and water management both diachronically and synchronically within Maya History. Timothy Beach holds The C.B.

A reception will follow. David Lake is a founding partner of Lake|Flato Architects, designers of the new Austin Central Library. Lake merges regional and environmental design to create site sensitive, distinctive architecture. As an architect, contractor and developer, he has broad experience in the built environment. Lake believes architecture must \u201cfit\u201d environmentally and contextually, molding our built traditions while looking toward future solutions, and connecting us to our place through the careful stewardship of our natural resources. Lake has a long-term commitment to sustainable design. For four years, he served as a board member of the Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems. He is also a longtime member of the American Solar Energy Society and has served as the Chairman of the Texas AIA Natural Resources Committee. A longtime advocate for development that both conserves our natural resources and creates contextually relevant architecture, Lake helped found the Coalition for Smart Growth, the Master Plan, and a Downtown Revitalization Plan for San Antonio. Furthermore, he developed San Antonio\u2019s Southside Initiative, Austin\u2019s Historic Zoning Ordinance, and Austin\u2019s Bicentennial Greenbelt Plan. Beyond ongoing downtown redevelopment projects in San Antonio, he is involved in urban design projects from Florida to California. An Austin native and University of Texas at Austin graduate, Lake has played a significant role in shaping the regional architectural discourse. ----- With a fresh and dynamic lineup of internationally renowned thought-leaders each semester, the Lectures + Exhibitions series is considered the signature public event series of the UT Austin School of Architecture.

Mavor takes special interest in the fairy tale\u2019s gastronomy, including Alice\u2019s Wonderland cake marked eat me, the sugar of the witch\u2019s house in "Hansel and Gretel" and the more disturbing ingestions of cannibalism, as in the Brothers Grimm\u2019s "The Juniper Tree", where a murdered boy sings through the mouth of a bird: "My mother she killed me. My father he ate me." Moving beyond this, Mavor discovers the fairy-tale realm in more surprising places: the tragic candy-land poetry of the 1950s "genius" child-poet Minou Drouet; the subterranean world of enchantment in the cave paintings of Lascaux; the brown fairies of African American poet Langston Hughes; and Miwa Yanagi\u2019s black-and-white, bloody photograph of the Grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood holding one another in the cut open belly of the wolf, as an allegory of the victims of Hiroshima. Through the lens of the fairy tale Mavor reads the world of literature and art as both magical and political. Carol Mavor is Professor of Art History and Visual Culture at the University of Manchester, England. As a writer who takes creative risks in form (literary and experimental) and political risks in content (sexuality, racial hatred, child-loving and the maternal), she has published widely on photography, cinema, colour and childhood. All her books, including Blue Mythologies: Reflections on a Colour (Reaktion, 2013), are richly illustrated with an eye on design. Her most recent monograph, Aurelia: Art and Literature through the Mouth of the Fairy Tale (Reaktion, 2017), is splashed with plenty of aurelian gold metallic ink and is perhaps the most beautiful of Mavor\u2019s publications: indeed, it is an \u2018artist\u2019s book\u2019.', 'hyperlink': u'https://calendar.utexas.edu/event/conversation_with_carol_mavor_author_of_aurelia_art_and_literature_through_the_mouth_of_the_fairy_tale', 'event_id': 0, 'datetime': '2017-10-31 15:30:00', 'location': u'Art Building (ART) 2301 SAN JACINTO BLVD , Austin, Texas 78712', 'name': u'Carol Mavor author of Aurelia: Art and Literature through the Mouth of the Fairy Tale'}, {'org_name': 'UT Campus', 'verified': 1, 'description': u"MONTHLY MEETUPS FOR LONGHORNS INTERESTED IN STARTUPS Whether you're looking to see what other creative students are up to, have a business idea of your own, or are in search of other ambitious students to join your startup team, UT Startup+Connect is the perfect event to kickstart your semester.

In this seminar, two presenters probe contemporary questions about the nature of the political through the lens of the ancient India. Renowned political theorist Rajeev Bhargava will explore pluralism in time of Ashoka (3rd cent. BCE) for insights into the theoretical problem of studying concepts from the ancient world in relation to modern political vocabulary and the practical challenge of taking ancient political ideas seriously.

Brown, Department of History, presents his new book, Cuba\u2019s Revolutionary World. Professor Kurt Weyland, Department of Government, participates as discussant. On January 2, 1959, Fidel Castro, the rebel comandante who had just overthrown Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, addressed a crowd of jubilant supporters. Recalling the failed popular uprisings of past decades, Castro assured them that this time "the real Revolution" had arrived. As Brown shows in this capacious history of the Cuban Revolution, Castro\'s words proved prophetic not only for his countrymen but for Latin America and the wider world. Cuba\'s Revolutionary World examines in forensic detail how the turmoil that rocked a small Caribbean nation in the 1950s became one of the twentieth century\'s most transformative events. Initially, Castro\'s revolution augured well for democratic reform movements gaining traction in Latin America. But what had begun promisingly veered off course as Castro took a heavy hand in efforts to centralize Cuba\'s economy and stamp out private enterprise. Embracing the Soviet Union as an ally, Castro and his lieutenant Che Guevara sought to export the socialist revolution abroad through armed insurrection. Castro\'s provocations inspired intense opposition. Cuban anticommunists who had fled to Miami found a patron in the CIA, which actively supported their efforts to topple Castro\'s regime. The unrest fomented by Cuban-trained leftist guerrillas lent support to Latin America\'s military castes, who promised to restore stability. Brazil was the first to succumb to a coup in 1964; a decade later, military juntas governed most Latin American states. Thus did a revolution that had seemed to signal the death knell of dictatorship in Latin America bring about its tragic opposite. Free and open to the public.
